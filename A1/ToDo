1. toggle flag using lock ?
2. increase count using lock ?
3. DDD - ps - read ptable after acquiring lock
4. DDD - msg queue implementation - acquire lock for ptable
5. DDD - intialize the queue on allocproc()
6. Create a marker so that a process does not implement nested signal handler

optional:
1. sig_set returns int, make it to return the old handler
2. it might be the case that b/w to user mode runs multiple sig handlers are executed(change this with introducing a variable blocker for sig in proc).
